Weirdtris is a hybrid of match-3 and tetris where you drop colored blocks into the middle pile trying to either get rid of all of them or a specified number. Later levels become more of a real puzzle game by not giving you all the colors available on the field.

This repository contains the freely available source code and assets for the game by [Retrocade.net](http://retrocade.net).
